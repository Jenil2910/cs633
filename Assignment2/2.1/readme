Steps to run:
- To run: `./run.sh` in 2.2 folder.
- To compile: `make` in 2.2 folder.
- To run specific config: `mpiexec -n 30 -hostfile ../hostfile ./src.x $D` in 2.2 folder.
- To generate hostfile: `make hostfile` in 2.2 folder.

Observations:
- In physical topology closer nodes will have greater effective bandwidth as no. of hops will be less giving less overall time. 
  This is easily seen by the fact that patches closer to diagonal are brighter.

- However, some faraway patches are better than closer ones. This may be due to one of 2 reasons. 
  One is that darker nodes might have suffered from network variability causing their synchronization steps to be unnecessarily long.
  Other is that even if the better pair has more difference in ranks, they are relatively closer in physical network topology.

- As D increases, we see clear contrast between elements near diagonal and those far away from it.
  This is because for large D, farther nodes will take more time as large message communication means rendezvous method and more packet transfer along TCP.

- For small D, there is less variance(heatmap does not change much). This is because for small data size eager method is used and requires very less packet transfer.

Other:
- plot folder contains all plots
  plot0-D means center is zero and D size
  plot1-D means center is not zero and D size
